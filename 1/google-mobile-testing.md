## Work Experience

**Senior Mobile Test Engineer @ Google**
*June 2022 – Present*

* Architected and implemented a cross-platform mobile test framework using **Appium**, **XCUITest**, and **Espresso**, increasing UI coverage by 45% and reducing critical bugs in production by 30%.
* Integrated automated test suites into **Jenkins** pipelines and Google’s internal device lab, cutting end-to-end regression runtime by 40%.
* Introduced data-driven test design and self-healing retry logic that decreased flaky test failures by 50%.
* Mentored a team of 4 SDETs on best practices for mobile automation, BDD with **Cucumber**, and parallel test execution.

**Mobile Testing Consultant @ OpenAI**
*December 2020 – Present*

* Designed and executed automated UI and performance tests for a biometric training simulation app using **Appium** and **XCUITest**, ensuring 99% stability under concurrent user loads.
* Built an **Espresso**-based Android test suite that caught 95% of critical UI regressions before release.
* Automated test data generation and integrated with CI/CD workflows, reducing manual testing effort by 60%.
* Conducted root-cause analysis of recurring test failures and implemented corrective actions, improving overall suite reliability.
